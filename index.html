          <p>"As an international student who is new to New York, I was amazed by how diversed NYC is in terms of culture and people who come from around the globe! People in NYC are different from each other in terms of their ethnicities, their nationalities, languages they speak, the outfits that they wear, and so so much more, so I became curious and wonder the SIMILARITIES of people in this diversed city with so many DIFFERENCES"</p>
